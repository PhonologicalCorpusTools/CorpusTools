CorpusTools 1.5.0 Release Notes
*******************************


New features
============

* Implemented a transitional probability algorithm for calculating the conditional probabilities between segments.

Duplicated Analyses
===================

* In prior versions of PCT, duplicated phonological searches / analyses often resulted in *cumulative* results, e.g., reported frequencies that summed over every instance of a repeated search. This has been corrected so that users are provided a warning when a search / analysis is duplicated, and either no change is made to the output table or the same results are repeated as a new line.

Phonological Search
===================

* Searches can be named.
* Searches can include word frequency, phoneme number, and syllable number filters.

String Similarity and Neighbourhood Density
===========================================

* Fixed some bugs that were causing the algorithm to crash when lists of words were added.

Mutual Information
==================

* Parameters for MI calculations have been clarified.
* Options have been added for calculating MI only within particular specified environments.

Functional Load
===============

* Calculation algorithms have been re-factored to make them faster.

Pronunciation Variants
======================

* Can be linked to lexical items through shared spelling.

Feature Systems
===============

* The feature systems have been updated to be more accurate.
* Feature systems are now stored within PCT itself instead of downloaded separately.
