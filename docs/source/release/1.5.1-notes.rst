CorpusTools 1.5.1 Release Notes
*******************************

Version 1.5.1 was released in May of 2022.

Phonological Search
===================

* A summary display option, "List target segments and environments separately in summary results" was added. By default,
  the summary results present each input environment as a row. The added option instead shows each target and environment
  separately. The individual results are identical between the two options.

Bug fixes
=========

* Autocompleting feature or segment selection with the tab key now works correctly.
* PCT can now import TextGrid files without issues.
